Demonstrate use of lambda expressions in the context of C++ <algorithm> use cases.

Lambdas:
  -Can customize many standard library algorithms' behavior by passing a function as an argument
  -Lambda expressions define anonymous functions â€“ usually inside other functions
  -Lambdas can manipulate an enclosing function's local variables (using &)
  -Convenient for expressing small tasks
