Demonstrate C++20's std::ranges algorithms: shuffle, count, count_if, min_element, max_element, minmax_element, transform

-shuffle: reorder the elements of a range
-count: count how many of a given value appear in a range
-count_if: count elements that match the criteria that is specified by a function object
-min_element: find the minimum element in a range
-max_element: find the maximum element in a range
-minmax_element: find the minimum and maximum element in a range
-transform: transform an element in range by modifying it with a function object
