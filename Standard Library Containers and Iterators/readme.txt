Standard Library Containers and Iterators:

-Containers and C++20 ranges
-I/O stream iterators
-Use iterators to access container elements
-Vector, list & deque sequence containers
-Use ostream_iterators with the std::copy and std::ranges::copy algorithms 
-set, multiset, map & multimap ordered associative containers
-ordered vs. unordered associative containers
-stack, queueand priority_queue container adaptors 
-bitset “near container” to manipulate bit flags
