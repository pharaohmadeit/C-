# Concepts Library (since C++20)

The concepts library provides definitions of fundamental library concepts that can be used to perform compile-time validation of template arguments and perform function dispatch based on properties of types.
Additional concepts can be found in the Iterators library, the Algorithms library, and the Ranges library.
