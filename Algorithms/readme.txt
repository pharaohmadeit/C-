C++20 Standard Library Algorithms
-C++20 std::ranges algorithms
-C++20 concepts for the C++20 std::ranges algorithmsâ€™ minimum iterator requirements
-compare C++20 std::ranges algorithms with older common-range standard algorithms
-use iterators with algorithms to access & manipulate standard library container elements
-customize standard library algorithms with lambdas, function pointers & function objects
-use projections to transform objects in a range while processing them with C++20 range algorithms
-use C++20 views and lazy evaluation with C++20 ranges
