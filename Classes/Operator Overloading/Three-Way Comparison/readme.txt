"SpaceTime" is an experimental user-defined class solely demonstrating the use of the C++20 three-way comparison (spaceship) operator

//  How the <=> operator works:
Less than: If a <=> b is less than 0, then 'a' is considered less than 'b'.
Equal: If a <=> b is equal to 0, then 'a' is considered equal to 'b'.
Greater than: If a <=> b is greater than 0, then 'a' is considered greater than 'b'.
